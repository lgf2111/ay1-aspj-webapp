# Access Control Policy



### **Pinciples of Least Privilege**
------


    The principle of least privilege limits users' access rights to only what are strictly required to do their jobs. Users are granted permission to read, write or execute only the files ot resources necessary to do their jobs. Thus, utilizing this principle, unauthorized users are unable to access restricted resources.



### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
----


    RBAC restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization. The roles in RBAC specifies the access level that an individual have to the network. With reference to our blog, we have 2 specific roles, the guest, user and admin. Guests are considered anonymous users that are not logged in. Authenticated users will only be able to create posts, comment on posts and update their accounts. Admins can access to the admin page which displays the users information, change the roles of each user and create posts, etc.


### **Access Control Matrix**
-----


    An Access Control Matrix refers to a table that defines the access permissions between specific user roles. By using this table matix, it can help admins to determine who can access a given object, as well as revoke all access to an object.
